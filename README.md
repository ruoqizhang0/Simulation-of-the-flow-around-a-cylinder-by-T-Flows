To better understand the simulation of turbulence and T-Flows, I pick the model, the flow around a cylinder.

The domain size is by a factor of ten, and the Re number by a factor of 250.

A sketch of the computational domain is presented here:

为了更好地理解湍流和T型流的模拟，我选择圆柱绕流模型。

计算域的尺寸扩大了十倍，雷诺数扩大了250倍。

计算域的示意图如下所示：
